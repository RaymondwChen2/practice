        <ul>
            <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick</li>
            <li>Soak them in cold water for at least an hour or overnight</li>
            <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat them completely dry</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don't overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won't be as crispy</li>
            <li>Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt.</li>
        </ul>
