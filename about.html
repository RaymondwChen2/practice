                Giveon Dezmann Evans (born February 21, 1995[3]), known as Giveon (typeset as GIVÄ’ON), is an American R&B singer and songwriter. 
                He rose to prominence with his collaboration with Drake on their 2020 single, "Chicago Freestyle". That same year, Giveon released the EPs,
                Take Time and When It's All Said and Done, the former being nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, and the latter reaching the Top 10 
                on the US Top R&B Albums chart. He released "Heartbreak Anniversary", as the second single from Take Time, which reached the Top 40 in the US 
                and was certified Platinum by RIAA. In 2021, Giveon was featured alongside Daniel Caesar on the Justin Bieber single "Peaches", which debuted 
                at number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 charts.

                Evans was born on February 21, 1995, in Los Angeles County[3] (likely in the city of Long Beach, California).[4][5] One of three brothers
                raised by a single mother, he realized his passion for music at a young age, often singing at birthday parties. He credits his mother
                with pushing him to explore this early love for music and protecting him and his brothers from the pressures of gang culture and
                poverty.[6] He attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School,[citation needed] and took a music education program at the Grammy
                Museum at age 18, where he fell in love with Frank Sinatra, whose bellowing voice was inspiring to the teenager.[7][2]
